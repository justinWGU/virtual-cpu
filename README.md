# Overview
This is my creation of a virtual CPU inspired by the book "CODE" by Charles Petzold. This project aims to simulate the CPU's fetch, decode, and execute cycle and its interaction with memory. This virtual CPU is built using C++. It will be able to execute assembly code and eventually have it's own high-level language to run complex programs.
